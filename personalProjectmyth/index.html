    <h1 style=font-family:cursive>Helen and The Trojan War</h1>
    <p>There were many different known causes of the Trojan War due to Oral tradition messing everything up. All causes have one thing in common though, and that is Paris, the prince of Troy, a Bronze age city. He had traveled to Sparta by the cunning Aphrodite, the goddess of sexual love and beauty, who promised him the fairest goddess in Sparta, Helen. When Paris saw Helen he had an infatuation when he saw her. Love at first sight, he wanted to marry her.</p>
    <p>Now this is where things get a little messy, some say that Paris kidnapped Helen while her husband, Menelaus was away, while others say that she was seduced by Paris and went willingly to Troy. Indirectly Paris, Aphrodite, and Helen were the cause of the Trojan War.The beginning of the war began when Helen's husband, Menelaus came home and found that Helen was missing. He looked everywhere and was worried, so he did what any worried husband would and asked the leaders of Greece for assistance, the leaders assured him that they would help him by all means, they then set sail an expedition for Troy, looking for Helen. </p>
    <p>The outcome of this search for Helen was none other than the infamous, Trojan War. It is believed to have taken place sometime in 13th century BCE or more commonly known as the Late Bronze Age. This widely known war was between the Greeks who were lead by their king, Agamemnon of Mycenae and of course, the Trojans lead by their king, King Priam. The whole war takes place in Anatolia which today is the country of Turkey. 
    <p>Now, this war was very protracted. It lasted 10 whole years, no one anticipated that it would actually last that long. These 10 years were filled with the Greek army being extremely impudent everywhere they went, showing no mercy. The official turning point of the war was, yes you guessed it, the notorious Trojan Horse. The story of the Trojan horse goes as follows. The Greek army desperately wanting to win the war, devised a plan. They built a gigantic wooden horse in which their soldiers would be in, and would give it to the Trojans as an offering to Athena. To make this believable one soldier would stay outside of the horse and tell the Trojans that the Greeks had made the horse as a peace offering for them. When the horse was brought inside the city of Troy the Greek soldiers emerged and ended the war not only giving Agamemnon a victory but also finally ending the 10 year long war.</p>

      <h1 style=font-family:cursive>The Story of Pyramus and Thisbe</h1>
      <p>A kind of similar fate like romeo and Juliet, Pyramus and Thisbe were both star crossed lovers, destined for a tragedy. Both were occupied in Babylon, with houses that connected by one wall, where they would talk to another. They were forbideen to marry because their parents had a rivarly among one another. So infatuated with each other they decide to meet under a mulberry tree.</p>
      <p>Thisbe arrives at the tree first, however, she see's a lion with blood in its mouth, so she escapes before it can attack her and leaves a piece of clothing behind. When Pyramus gets to the tree he thinks that Thisbe was killed and is heartbroken (this is practically the story of Romeo and Juliet but with a greek twist in it)</p>
      <p>He comes to the conclusion that without Thisbe, there is no reason to live. He kills himself, and blood splatters everywhere, even on the mulberry tree.</p>
      <p>Thisbe then returns and finds Pyramus dead, devastated she kills herself as well</p>
      <p>In honor of Pyramus and Thisbe's love, the gods changed the mulberry fruit into the color of the blood stain which was splattered on them when Pyramus killed himself</p>
      <p>And that was the end of their love story</p>

        <h1 style=font-family:cursive>Pandora's Box</h1>
        <p>Pandora, the first woman created in greek mythology by Hephaestus, was used as revenge. Zeus, the king of gods, was upset with Prometheus, another god who had helped the mortal world out. So Zeus had Hephaestus create Pandora, who was given a gift by each god/goddess. Needless to say she was almost perfect.</p>
        <p>Of course Zeus had a plan, he gave Pandora a special jar, which he told her not to open. </p>
        <p>He then sent her towards Epimetheus, Prometheus's brother, who ultimatley fell in love with her and wed her. </p>
        <p>Not being able to resist the temptation of opening the jar, Pandora opened it. Inside containted every evil imaginable-war,death,heartbreak, etc. </p>
        <p>She tried her best to close the lid back up after realizing her mistake, however, it was too late.</p>
        <p>Pandora's Box is now symbolism for "Any source of great and unexpected troubles"</p>
        <p>sidenote: because history was translated down from word of mouth back then, it is not confirmed if it was a box or a jar.</p>
