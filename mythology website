<p>I thought it would be cool to have my section of the page be about memes because they are entertaining. </p>
<h1> <em>What Are Memes?</em></h1>
</div>
<p>Memes are practically "an idea, behavior, or style that spreads by means of imitation from person to person within a culture-often with the aim of conveying a particular phenomenon, theme, or meaning represented by the meme" (Wikipedia).They are used to fulfill a type of humor and are popular on social media platforms as well.</p>
<!--used a horizontal line to divide the definition of memes from the actual content in memes and how to create them-->
<hr>
<!-- I italicized each title so that it would stand out-->
<h1> <em>Types of Memes</em></h1>
<div>
  <!--a bullet point list to describe the categories of memes-->
<p>There are many forms of memes, each are divided into three categories...</p>
<ul>
    <li>Classic Memes: Are usually cultural referenced and pretty basic, everyone gets what the joke is, these go back to the early 00s.</li>
    <li>Wholesome Memes: They are postive messages either of encouragment or compliments, they are still used in todays society.</li>
    <li>Dank Memes: Very dark humor so many people dont find them funny, however they are original and appeal to some. They are still looked at in todays society.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<!--inserted a numbered list to show step by step on how to create a meme-->
<h1><em>How To Create a Meme</em></h1>
<ol>
<li>First off you need to choose the type of meme you want to make, this can be any from the three categories above.</li>
<li>Now, depending on which type of meme you chose you need to decide what it will be about. It can either be referencing a culture, historical event, or even an inside joke you have with the people you are sharing it with. </li>
<li>Next,you should choose an image that relates with the reference u decided on doing </li>
<li>Finally, you can add the written content you want over the image (most people use the impact font) and thats it!</li>
<P><em> P.S if you dont want to put that much effort in creating a meme then you can just use any meme generator app:) </em></P>
